			The importance of talking about mental health cannot be overstressed. As a part of our mental health programs in South Florida, we work with patients that are all too often afraid to talk about their mental health disorders outside of treatment. Because of this, we want people to understand the benefits of talking about mental health and encourage people to talk openly about mental health.</center></p>
